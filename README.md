## TREN: A Corpus Annotation Tool for Code-Switching Data

TREN is a system developed for the annotation and analysis of Turkish–English code-switching data in corpus-based linguistic research. It is designed as a semi-automatic annotation application that integrates automatic processing with user-controlled manual intervention, enabling transparent and reproducible analysis of code-switching phenomena, with a particular focus on intra-word code-switching.

The system consists of an interactive graphical annotation interface and an underlying processing pipeline. Through the interface, users can load raw textual data, preprocess it into token-based representations, and inspect or revise automatically assigned labels. The processing pipeline supports language identification, rule-based morphological analysis, and sentence-level computations, facilitating fine-grained analysis of bilingual data.

TREN’s features include, for instance:

• semi-automatic token-level language identification for Turkish and English  
• support for the annotation of intra-word code-switching structures  
• rule-based detection of Turkish morphemes attached to English stems  
• morphological glossing based on the Leipzig Glossing Rules  
• interactive manual correction and user supervision of automatic labels  
• concordance (KWIC) and frequency-based inspection tools  
• automatic computation of Matrix Language and Embedded Language at the sentence level  
• flexible export of annotated data in `.csv` and `.txt` formats  

TREN is intended for use by researchers working on bilingual and multilingual language data, particularly in contexts where fine-grained annotation of code-switching is required. Typical application areas include:
• code-switching and bilingual language use  
• corpus linguistics  
• morphology and morphosyntax   
• discourse-oriented and usage-based linguistic analysis
